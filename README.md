# About Me
## My Interests
	Dungeons and Dragons is my main hobby. I also play a lot of video games and work as a researcher for a video game company.
## Websites I Recommend
	* [YNAB](https://app.ynab.com) - YNAB, or You Need a Budget, is a great tool for managing your money and budget. I use it every single day!
	* [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) - D&D Beyond is a digital platform that makes playing Dungeons and Dragons really easy! My friends and I use D&D Beyond to play almost every week.
